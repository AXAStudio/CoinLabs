# SimulatedCryptoExchange

Project Proposal: 
I want to simulate a crypto exchange with various simulated fake cryptocurrencies. I would like to try to mimic how real cryptocurrencies interact with supply and demand as well as news articles. The goal would be to make a contained crypto exchange within an API. If I have extra time, I could even simulate altcoins with god-candle spikes.
